# Compgen Course 2025: Multi-omics Integration Using Deep Learning

This repository contains three homework assignments that I have completed as part of the Compgen Course 2025, Module 3: Multi-omics Integration Using Deep Learning. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of computational biology and bioinformatics.

## Assignments

### Homework 1: Modeling Breast Cancer Subtypes

**Description:**  
This task involves using a multi-omic dataset of Breast Cancer samples from the METABRIC consortium. The dataset includes gene expression, copy number alteration, mutation, and clinical metadata. The goal is to explore and analyze these features to classify breast cancer subtypes effectively.

### Homework 2: Finding Survival Markers in Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) and Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)

**Description:**  
This task involves analyzing a multi-omic dataset of brain cancer samples, including LGG and GBM. The objective is to identify survival markers by leveraging mutation and copy number alteration data alongside clinical information. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

### Homework 3: Benchmarking Different Deep Learning Architectures and Omic Data Modalities for Cancer Cell Lines

**Description:**  
This task focuses on benchmarking various deep learning models using multi-omic data from human cancer cell lines. Models are trained on one dataset and evaluated on another to assess generalizability. The assignment involves testing different deep learning architectures, combining multiple data modalities, and comparing fusion methods. The results are analyzed in a Jupyter notebook to determine the best-performing models and key predictive biomarkers.
